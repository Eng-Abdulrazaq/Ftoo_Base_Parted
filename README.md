# Robot Ftoo's Torso Parted

This git contains the torso of Robot Ftoo segmented into 18 parts. It is required to breakdown the body into small parts so that each one is 3D printed. [Click here to have .stl files](https://github.com/Eng-Abdulrazaq/Ftoo_Base_Parted/tree/master/STL) of all parts.

## Note:
```
Parts are joined with screws. 
Only indentations at holes locations are modeled, not through all holes. 
This is because the screw size is suggested. 
However, it depends on availability of sizes in inventory, 
But screws more than 3 mm are not recommended, as they might require changes in model dimensions.
```


This model was made with Autodesk Fusion 360. So, for convenience, [Click here to find .f3d files](https://github.com/Eng-Abdulrazaq/Ftoo_Base_Parted/tree/master/f3d%20File) of all parts, the extension of Autodesk Fusion 360.

All parts are labeled with a letter and a number modeled indicating its location according to the assembly layout, and also an arrow pointing to upward direction. The layout is fond as .pdf file [here](https://github.com/Eng-Abdulrazaq/Ftoo_Base_Parted/blob/master/Ftoo_Assembly_Layout.pdf).
 
It is suggested to use 18 pieces of 2 mm screws, whose model as (.STEP) file an details are provided [here](https://github.com/Eng-Abdulrazaq/Ftoo_Base_Parted/tree/master/Suggested%20screw).
